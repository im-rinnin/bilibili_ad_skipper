# Progress Log

## Initial Setup
- Memory Bank created on 2025-09-22
- Project in Phase 1: Foundation complete
- Next: Begin Phase 2 - Research Bilibili subtitle APIs

## Recent Changes
- Researched Bilibili subtitle APIs using task agent; identified player API endpoints and parameters.
- Analyzed sample API response and subtitle JSON format (timestamps, content, music detection).
- Updated manifest.json with host_permissions for API access.
- Implemented basic subtitle fetching in content.js: Extract bvid from URL, fetch view API for cid, fetch player API for subtitles, parse JSON.
- Passed linting and tests.
- Completed implementation of fetchPlayerInfo and fetchSubtitles functions.
- Updated init() to fetch and log subtitle data on video pages.

## Current Tasks
- Test subtitle fetching on sample Bilibili videos (load extension in Chrome, navigate to video with subtitles).
- Verify console logs show fetched subtitle data.
- Begin Phase 3: Choose AI service for ad detection (e.g., OpenAI API).
- Implement API key management in Chrome storage.

## Session Synthesis
**Key Points:**
- Memory bank established for project tracking.
- Completed research on Bilibili subtitle APIs: Player API (https://api.bilibili.com/x/player/v2) for metadata, subtitle JSON with timestamps/content.
- Analyzed sample API response and subtitle file (AI-generated with music detection).

**Decisions:**
- Use Bilibili player API for subtitle fetching; requires SESSDATA cookie and host_permissions.
- Implement fetching logic in content.js to extract video IDs, fetch APIs, and parse JSON.

**Action Items:**
- Update manifest.json with host_permissions for api.bilibili.com and aisubtitle.hdslb.com.
- Code subtitle fetching in content.js.
- Test on sample Bilibili videos and run lint/tests.

## Learnings
- Chrome extension development basics
- Manifest V3 requirements
- Bilibili API endpoints and authentication (SESSDATA cookies)
- Subtitle JSON structure: {content, from, to} with music detection
