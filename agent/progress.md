# Progress Log

## Initial Setup
- Memory Bank created on 2025-09-22
- Project in Phase 1: Foundation complete
- Next: Begin Phase 2 - Research Bilibili subtitle APIs

## Recent Changes
- Researched Bilibili subtitle APIs using task agent; identified player API endpoints and parameters.
- Analyzed sample API response and subtitle JSON format (timestamps, content, music detection).
- Updated manifest.json with host_permissions for API access.
- Implemented basic subtitle fetching in content.js: Extract bvid from URL, fetch view API for cid, fetch player API for subtitles, parse JSON.
- Passed linting and tests.
- Completed implementation of fetchPlayerInfo and fetchSubtitles functions.
- Updated init() to fetch and log subtitle data on video pages.
- Chose Gemini 2.5 Flash for AI ad detection.
- Added @google/genai dependency to package.json.
- Integrated Gemini API in content.js for subtitle analysis with prompt engineering.
- Implemented Chrome storage for API key management.
- Updated Jest configuration for ES modules and mocked GoogleGenAI.
- Passed lint and tests.
- Refined AI prompt for better ad detection accuracy.
- Updated ad logging to use {adstart_time:*,ad_endtime:*} format.
- Added popup UI for API key input (popup.html, popup.js).
- Updated manifest.json with action for popup.
- Updated lint script to include popup.js.
- Added console logging for full subtitles in analyzeSubtitles.
- Changed initial console log to 'hello_im_ad_skipper'.
- Fixed ES module import error by using dynamic import for @google/genai in analyzeSubtitles.
- Added console logging for Gemini request prompt and response.
- Added webpack bundling for content script to resolve module resolution in extension context.
- Updated manifest.json to load content.bundle.js.
- Updated build script to run webpack.
- Added "[ad_skip]" prefix to all console.log statements for easy identification.
- Updated webpack config with LimitChunkCountPlugin to force single bundle file, resolving ChunkLoadError.
- Implemented ad skipping logic: monitor video timeupdate, skip to ad endTime when entering ad segment.
- Fixed JSON parsing error by stripping markdown code blocks from Gemini response.

## Current Tasks
- Test ad skipping on sample Bilibili videos with detected ads.
- Verify video jumps over ad segments (e.g., from 723.53 to 790.28).
- Monitor console for skipping logs.
- Refine skipping logic if needed (e.g., handle multiple ads, user feedback).

## Session Synthesis
**Key Points:**
- Memory bank established for project tracking.
- Completed research on Bilibili subtitle APIs: Player API (https://api.bilibili.com/x/player/v2) for metadata, subtitle JSON with timestamps/content.
- Analyzed sample API response and subtitle file (AI-generated with music detection).

**Decisions:**
- Use Bilibili player API for subtitle fetching; requires SESSDATA cookie and host_permissions.
- Implement fetching logic in content.js to extract video IDs, fetch APIs, and parse JSON.

**Action Items:**
- Update manifest.json with host_permissions for api.bilibili.com and aisubtitle.hdslb.com.
- Code subtitle fetching in content.js.
- Test on sample Bilibili videos and run lint/tests.

## Learnings
- Chrome extension development basics
- Manifest V3 requirements
- Bilibili API endpoints and authentication (SESSDATA cookies)
- Subtitle JSON structure: {content, from, to} with music detection
